# ytAlbumToMP3
This program is a simple tool made to use yt-dlp (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for downloading and formatting larger lists of specified albums from ytMsc to then be placed within organized folders.

I have no association with yt-dlp and take no credit for their amazing work that does the downloading 
and formatitng of the files. I am new to actually posting my code as a "complete" project and mainly
made this for fun, so if you have any reccomendations or tips please lmk! emjoy :)

**How to Use:**

**1.** Create a file called "links.txt"
**2.** Copy and paste each desired album URL (one URL per line)
**3.** Ensure links.txt, yt-dlp.exe, and ffmpeg.exe are in the same directory
